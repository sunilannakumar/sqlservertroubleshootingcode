Note : - An I/O latch wait occurs when a page is accessed for reading or writing but the page is not available in the buffer pool. It causes waits on PAGEIOLATCH_EX or PAGEIOLATCH_SH, depending upon the type of request. These wait types can indicate an I/O bottleneck






I/O latch wait statistics
------------------------

Select  wait_type,         waiting_tasks_count,         wait_time_ms  from    sys.dm_os_wait_stats where    wait_type like 'PAGEIOLATCH%'
order by wait_type






pending I/O requests and isolating the disks,File and database in which we have I/O Bottleneck
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


select     database_id,     file_id,     io_stall,     io_pending_ms_ticks,     scheduler_address from    sys.dm_io_virtual_file_stats(NULL, NULL)t1,         sys.dm_io_pending_io_requests as t2
where    t1.file_handle = t2.io_handle









How to  troubleshoot?
-------------------------

1.  Exclude SQL Server files from antivirus scan.

2. Do not place SQL Server FILES on compressed drives.

3. Distribute SQL Server data files and transaction log files across drives.

4. If the “I/O request taking longer” warning is for tempdb , Enable trace flag 1118 and increase the tempdb data files refer:http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2154845

5. If none of the above resolves the issue collect the below perfmon counters. 



Avg. Disk sec/Transfer --> Time taken to perform the I/O operation
Disk Bytes /sec   --> Total read and write to disk per second in bytes.
Process:IO Data Bytes/Sec --> Total read and write to disk per second in bytes by each process.
Buffer Manager: Page Read/sec + Page Writes/sec -->Total read and write to disk per second in bytes by SQL Server process.
