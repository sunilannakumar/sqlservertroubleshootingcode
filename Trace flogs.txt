Stop logging all successful backups in your SQL Server error logs
----------------------------------------------------------------

3226 (Turn on manually) :-

By default, every successful backup operation adds an entry in the SQL Server error log and in the system event log. 
If you create very frequent log backups, these success messages accumulate quickly, 
resulting in huge error logs in which finding other messages is problematic. 
With this trace flag, you can suppress these log entries.
 This is useful if you are running frequent log backups and if none of your scripts depend on those entries
