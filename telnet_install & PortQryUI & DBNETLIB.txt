Depending on the client data provider (MDAC/SNAC/SqlClient) we may get errors like below (or a variant of these) –

“[DBNETLIB][ConnectionOpen (Connect()).]SQL Server does not exist or access denied.”

“Login timeout expired”

“[Microsoft][SQL Native Client]An error has occurred while establishing a connection to the server. When connecting to SQL Server 2005, this failure may be caused by the fact that under the default settings SQL Server does not allow remote connections”

“A network-related or instance-specific error occurred while establishing a connection to SQL Server. The server was not found or was not accessible. Verify that the instance name is correct and that SQL Server is configured to allow remote connections”
