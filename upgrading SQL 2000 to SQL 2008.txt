Upgrading an instance of the SQL Server 2000 Database Engine to a newer version retains the configuration value for max worker threads.

SQL Server 2008 instance with 8 processors will create 576 worker threads but in sp_configure it is hardcoded to 128 threads which caused contention in this case.

So we then changed this value to

EXEC sp_configure 'max worker threads',0

RECONFIGURE WITH  OVERRIDE

and restarted instance, now we longer have the 18056 error.
